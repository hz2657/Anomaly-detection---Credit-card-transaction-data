# Feature Engineering for Credit Card Fraud Detection

A credit card fraud detection algorithm consists in identifying those transactions with a high probability of being fraud, based on historical fraud patterns. The use of machine learning in fraud detection has been an interesting topic in recent years. Most of these studies compare their proposed algorithms with a benchmark algorithm and then make the comparison using a standard binary classification measure, such as misclassification error, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov (KS), F1 Score (Bolton et al., 2002; Hand et al., 2007) or AUC statistics (Dal Pozzolo et al., 2014). Most of these measures are extracted by using a confusion matrix as shown below:
